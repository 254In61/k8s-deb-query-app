Overview
========
- Tool made up of 3 main parts.

- 1) Database : MySQL Database with a table called "countries"

- 2) Server script : Script that runs within the DB Server , which perfoms SQL querries to the DB.

- 3) client end : Client script picks options, and sends a string over the network socket to a listening server. Server translates the string into an SQL query.

- Design obsifucates the DB Server from external environment.

TESTING
========
=> Pytest redirecting source to AWS??  :  $ sudo apt-get install python3-pytest

1) Unittests

- pyytest of specific classes within the ServerModules.

2) Integration testing
